### Collections have four basic flavours:
- <b>List</b>: An ordered collection (seqÄ±ence); provides precise control over access to an element using its integer index; duplicate elements are allowed
  - <b>Arraylist</b>: A growable array; fast iteration and fast random access; use when you are not likely to do much insertion/deletion (shuffling required).
  - <b>LinkedList</b>: Elements are doubly-linked to each other; fast insertion/deletion.
  - <b>Stack</b>: Represent a list-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. The "Deque" interface an its implementations are more complete and should be used instead.

- <b>Set</b>: Collections with no duplicate elements
  - <b>HashSet</b>
    - Unsorted, unordered <i>Set</i>, uses the hashcode of the object being inserted; the more efficient your <i>hashCode()</i> implementation, the better access performance you will get.
    - use this class when you want to a collection with no duplicates and you don't care about order when you iterate through it.
  - <b>LinkedHashSet</b>
    - an ordered version of <i>HashSet</i> (insertion order).
    - elements are doubly-lined to each other
    - use this class instead of HashSet when you care about the iteration order.
  - <b>TreeSet</b>
    - a sorted collection ("Tree")
    - elements can be sorted according to their "natural order" - for <i>String</i>'s the natural order is alphabetic; for <i>Integer'</i>s, the natural order is numeric.
