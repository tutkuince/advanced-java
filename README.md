### Collections have four basic flavours:
- <b>List</b>: An ordered collection (seqÄ±ence); provides precise control over access to an element using its integer index; duplicate elements are allowed
  - <b>Arraylist</b>: A growable array; fast iteration and fast random access; use when you are not likely to do much insertion/deletion (shuffling required).
  - <b>LinkedList</b>: Elements are doubly-linked to each other; fast insertion/deletion.
  - <b>Stack</b>: Represent a list-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. The "Deque" interface an its implementations are more complete and should be used instead.
