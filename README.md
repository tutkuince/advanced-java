### Collections have four basic flavours:
- <b>List</b>: An ordered collection (seqÄ±ence); provides precise control over access to an element using its integer index; duplicate elements are allowed
  - <b>Arraylist</b>: A growable array; fast iteration and fast random access; use when you are not likely to do much insertion/deletion (shuffling required).
  - <b>LinkedList</b>: Elements are doubly-linked to each other; fast insertion/deletion.
  - <b>Stack</b>: Represent a list-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. The "Deque" interface an its implementations are more complete and should be used instead.

- <b>Set</b>: Collections with no duplicate elements
  - <b>HashSet</b>
    - Unsorted, unordered <i>Set</i>, uses the hashcode of the object being inserted; the more efficient your <i>hashCode()</i> implementation, the better access performance you will get.
    - use this class when you want to a collection with no duplicates and you don't care about order when you iterate through it.
  - <b>LinkedHashSet</b>
    - an ordered version of <i>HashSet</i> (insertion order).
    - elements are doubly-lined to each other
    - use this class instead of HashSet when you care about the iteration order.
  - <b>TreeSet</b>
    - a sorted collection ("Tree")
    - elements can be sorted according to their "natural order" - for <i>String</i>'s the natural order is alphabetic; for <i>Integer'</i>s, the natural order is numeric.

- <b>Map</b>: maps keys to values; keys are unique; each key can map to at most one value
  - <b>HashMap</b>
    - unsorted, unordered <i>Map</i>.
    - uses the hashcode of the object being inserted; the more efficient your <i>hashCode()</i> implementation, the better access performance you will get.
    - use this class when you want a <i>Map</i> and you don't care about order when you iterate through it.
    - allows one <i>null</i> key and multiple <i>null</i> values.
  - <b>LinkedHashMap</b>
    - maintains insertion order
  - <b>TreeMap</b>
    - a sorted Map; sorted by natural order of it's keys or by a custom order(via a comparator)
  - <b>Hashtable</b>
    - similar to <i>HashMap</i> except <i>Hashtable</i> is thread-safe(slower) anbd nulls are not allowed.

- <b>Queue</b>: a collection that specifies the order in which elements are to be processed.
  - Typically the order is FIFO (First In First Out).
  - Exceptions are priority queues ( order is natural ordering or according to a supplied comparator) and LIFO (Last In First Out) queues (stacks).
  - LinkedList
    - as <i>LinkedList</i> implements <i>Queue</i>; basic queues can be handled with a <i>LinkedList</i>
